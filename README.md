# NLP Deep Learning Classification Model  
This project implements an **NLP Deep Learning Classification Model** that assigns accurate tags or specifications to products, problems, or user complaints based on input text. The model is designed to process data quickly and deliver high-performance results, making it ideal for various industries.  

## Key Features  
- **Accurate Classification**: Identifies the correct tag or specification with high precision.  
- **Fast Processing**: Ensures quick turnaround times for text inputs.
- **Algorithm used**: Makes use of Convulational Neural Network for maximuim accuracy. 
- **Scalable Solution**: Capable of handling large volumes of textual data.  

## Applications  
The NLP Deep Learning Classification Model has versatile applications:  
1. **Banking**:  
   - Classify customer complaints into categories like loan issues, transaction errors, or account management.  
   - Automate tagging for faster issue resolution.  
2. **E-Commerce**:  
   - Assign product categories based on user reviews or descriptions.  
   - Enhance product search and filtering capabilities.  
3. **Customer Support**:  
   - Tag and prioritize user complaints for efficient ticket resolution.  
   - Provide automated routing of issues to the correct departments.  
4. **Healthcare**:  
   - Categorize patient feedback or complaints to improve services.
   
  
**Cost-Effective**: Minimizes operational costs by automating repetitive tasks.
